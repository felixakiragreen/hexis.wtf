## The Inception

Two rules guided the creative approach of _Hexis_: We wanted to represent the strengths of the mechanized being by programming a generative system and we wanted to represent the strengths of the organic being by using nature’s favorite and most stable shape - the hexagon.

By playing with the unique shape of the hexagon, we arrived at a two-dimensional shape in which three identical tiles combine to form the hexagon. The randomly generated tiles are put into motion, inventing the new form of a 3D surface and implying a cuboid shape.

As the tiles dance across the faux 3D surface of the hexagon floating in a void, the metadata openly displayed in the top left corner communicates the role of the machine’s algorithm in the origin of each _Hexis_.

## The Name

Many generative projects focus on how generative systems create similar artistic artifacts or on the distribution channel of crypto technologies – CryptoCubes, CryptoSkulls, CryptoDonuts, CryptoKitties, CryptoJunks, the list goes on and on. We didn’t want the collection to be another “crypto” collectible in this vein.

We came across the Ancient Greek word _Hexis_. Phonetically it alludes to the hex of a hexagon while also relating to the idea of stability and active creation; something that is acquired and hardened through shared and interactive action. “_Hexis_ means in one sense an activity,” Aristotle wrote nearly two millenia ago, “when one thing makes and another is made, there is between them an act of making” (Aristotle, Metaphysics 5.1022b). It was perfect.

## The Concept

The project takes a semi-curated approach, embracing the generative madness of the app with the soft guidance of the artist’s hand. We wanted to show the full range of what an app could produce but also give structure to the collection. Each _Hexis_ is produced by a generative app we designed and programmed ourselves, with inputs that act as interventions and guidance to the generator including color, line and size.

Each _Hexis_ is created one at a time by a human artist in concert with the app, representing the journey of creation and tendency toward stability captured by Aristotle in his original description of _Hexis_. The collection takes the form of a narrative journey of creation that spans an entire year. Each _Hexis_ builds on the journey of creative discovery and co-creation between man and machine.

## The Execution

Every Friday, at 9am ET in the year 2021, we mint one _Hexis_ NFT. The year has 52 weeks, there will be 52 NFTs in season 01. The price of each work will be determined by its episode number, for example E01 will be 0.01 ETH, E02 will be 0.02 ETH and so on.

## The Future

As season 1 of _Hexis_ continues, you may be curious about our plans for the future. When is season 2? Will it be something new or more of the same? Time will tell. _Hexis_ is an exploration, an experiment, a collaboration, guided by two rules: be generative and hexagonal.
